            Tony Tony Chopper is the best character in One Piece. While many may find him annoying, unlikeable, or downright frustrating,
            I believe chopper is one of, if not the best character in one piece. He is very reliable, and always wants to help other people. He is
            a very knowledgeable doctor, and knows how to analyze and treat any diseases. 
            <!--<span class = "my-quote">I love toasting my hot-pockets in the toaster oven, it makes them taste extra good, and I enjoy
            the crispy shell on the outside. HotPockets are very underrated as a food item, and I think other people should try them
            they are missing out for sure!</span> <span class = "my-quote name">-- are021</span> -->
